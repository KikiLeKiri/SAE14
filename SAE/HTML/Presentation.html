                <h1> Who I am ? </h1>
                <br> 
                I am ROHFRITSCH Kilian, I’m 18 years old and I’m doing a bachelor’s in networks and 
                telecommunication. I chose to do my studies in the network, because I have always been 
                interested by these technologies and I would like to work in this area.

                <h2> My school cursus </h2>
                I was in a German bilingual class until the “Troisième”, saw I have now a B1 level in 
                German. I studied in high school "Louis Marchal", my 2 specialties were : engineering 
                Sciences and digital science and computer science. I chose these 2 matters because I 
                really love them and they were in my centre of interest.

                <h3>What I want to do after my bachelor ? </h3>
                Today I didn’t really know what I’m going to do after my bachelor… For the moment I’m 
                waiting the second year because I really want to work in alternately. This will show me 
                the real life outside of studies and I think that’s it could be chose if I want to continue 
                my studies after my bachelor or if I go to work.
